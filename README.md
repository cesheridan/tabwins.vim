**Scenarios**

_tabwins.vim_ enables developers to create _predefined sets of tabs with designed window structures_, for scenarios that include:
* **Research into established libraries**, viewed from galleries of meaningfully-arranged, many-windowed tabs
* **Multiple-terminal sessons** where the developer both edits and interacts with static or varying sets of network terminals
* **File system scans** for quick assessment of what is and is not present in the core directories of an OS instance

__**The Developer:**__
  * Avoids hit-or-miss, time-consuming, manual, repetitious runs of :split/:vsplit
    
  * Avoids detours thinking about how to produce an intended window structure

  * Avoids losing current configurations due to mid-session reloads of backed-up Vim sessions that have preferred window structures

  * Avoids loss of focus from these discontinuities

#### 3 TABWINS COMMANDS

These commands take the same arguments and accept arbitrary dimension specification, unconstrained by configuration vars, other than any windows-per-tab limits in Vim.


````vim
    :Tabwins 
    " Same as :TabwinsVertical
    " Default alias :T 
   
    :TabwinsVertical  
    " Priority to the vertical axis.
    " Default alias :V 
   
    :TabwinsHorizontal  
    " Priority to the horizontal axis.
    " Default alias :H 
 ````

# USAGE

### Tabwins Menu

[tabwins_menu]: ./doc/images/tabwins_menu.jpg?raw=true  "tabwins_menu"
![alt text][tabwins_menu]
    
_tabwins.vim_ helps developers _avoid the nuisances_ mentioned above, by _**making complex window structures quickly-built, persistent, and easily-invoked**_.  

The 'Tabwins' menu exemplifies this.

Most of the  tab builders referenced here are defined in tabwins.vim, and several of these are available from the 'Tabwins' menu.

The _**developer is encouraged to customize**_ this menu and its _tabwins.vim_ commands for local use.  Update **Tabwins_menu_build()** to do so.  

The extent that **populated tabs** invoked from this menu load their buffers is dependent on shell vars available to the Vim session, and files/dirs present in the local environment -- again, this menu is intended as _a starting point_ for the developer to 'fill-in' with local content.

Global **g:load_tabwins_menu_is_wanted** is defaulted to **'Y'** and can be set to 'N' to turn off this menu.


### Symmetric Window Structures 
[gif2]:  ./doc/gif/tabwins.2dimension.HV.gif?raw=true  "gif2"
![alt text][gif2]

Sourcing _tabwins.vim_ creates **symmetric tab-builder commands** of the form :{V|H}IxJ, where the IxJ permutation set defines on:
````vim
      g:tabwins_max_v_size  
      g:tabwins_max_h_size  
````
In a symmetric structure, all secondary axis dimensions are the same.  This permits shorter Ex line command names.

The simplest symmetric structures have _only 1 dimension with length >1_, as shown in the 2nd graphic on this page. 


_Structures with 2 dimensions with length >1_ are shown immediately above.

**'H'** indicates horizontal priority, **'V'** vertical priority -- _SEE: 'VERTICAL & HORIZONTAL'_

````vim
    :V5x8 
    :H5x8 
    :V8x14 
    :H8x14 
   
    :V6x1
    :V6 
    :H6
````


### Asymmetric Window Structures 
[gif3]: ./doc/gif/tabwins.2dimension.asym.HV.gif?raw=true "gif3"
![alt text][gif3]

In an asymmetric window, secondary axis dimensions vary, and _axis-specification syntax is different_ than for symmetric windows.
````vim
    :Tabwins 1211 
    :T       1211 
    " For a new tab of 4 columns of 1, 2, 1, & 1 windows successively
    " left to right.
   
    :TabwinsHorizontal 4221 
    :H                 4221 
    " For a new tab of 4 rows, with 4,2,2, & 1 windows successively 
    " top to bottom "
 ````


### Dimensions >9
[gt9]: ./doc/gif/tabwins.2dimension.HV.GT9.gif?raw=true  "gt9"
![alt text][gt9]

For tabs with one or both dimensions >9, use list syntax as below.

````vim
    :Tabwins [ 5, 8, 13, 21 ] 
    :T       [ 5, 8, 13, 21 ] 
    " For a 4-column tab with 5, 8, 13, 21 windows successively left to right.
   
    :Tabwins [ 14, 14 ] 
    :T       [ 14, 14 ] 
    " Or,      :V2x14
   
    :Tabwins [ 40, 30, 40, 30 ] 
    :T       [ 40, 30, 40, 30 ] 
    " For really big monitors ...  " 
````

### Fill Specs 

[fill_specs]: ./doc/gif/tabwins.2dimension.HV.populated.gif?raw=true  "fill_specs"
![alt text][fill_specs]

'fill_specs' enable the developer to specify that _tabwins.vim_ **fill buffers with files and directories**, and along with those, or instead of those, the **outputs of commands** specified in a fill_spec, including **command sequences** where '|' bars separate the commands.

````vim
:Tabwins           11111; $HOME, '/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
:T                 {                  same args                        } 

:V5x1 $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
" Structure & content same as :Tabwins 11111 above

:V5   $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
" Same result again: since the secondary axis has only 1 
" window for its dimensions, V5 is available as an even
" shorter alias.

:Tabwins            1211; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
:T                  {                  same args                        } 
" 'fill_content' specs of files are automatically opened via :edit,
" while specs of dirs are opened via :Explore
" (Specify the '' empty string for windows intended to be empty.)


:TabwinsHorizontal 11111; $HOME, '/.bashrc', '/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
:H                        {                  same args                } 
" FLIP axis priority of above to the horizontal

:Tabwins             312; '/.bashrc', '/.vimrc', '/.git', $HOME, '/', '/usr/bin' 
:T                        {                  same args                         } 

:Tabwins 1112;  $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', 'Explore /usr/bin | resize 20' 
:T       {                           same args                                    } 
" Does a :resize of the last window, via Vim '|' command concat.  If a file 
" or dir is followed with concated commands, the caller needs to explicitly 
" add the command that opens the file or dir, e.g. 'Explore' here." 
````


### Tab Options 

Available tab options are below, with global default vars on the right.  

These options apply to the entire tab and can be combined when separated by commas. 
      
````vim
       'explore_cmd_name'          : g:tabwins_explore_cmd_name_default,
       'netrw_liststyle'           : g:tabwins_netrw_liststyle_default,
       'line_number_at_window_top' : g:tabwins_netrw_line_number_default,
   
      " => Use a fill_spec for window-specific override of the 
      "   above options  
   
       'first_window_number'       : g:tabwins_first_window_number_default,
      " => window population starts with this number, so you wouldn't
      "   have to have to have a fill_spec for lower-numbered windows.
   
       'ending_window_number'      : g:tabwins_ending_window_number_default,
      " => the active window number after tabwins.vim builds a tab"
````
   
##### Examples
````vim
    :Tabwins 1211; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'ending_window_number' : 2 
    :Tabwins 1211; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'netrw_liststyle'      : 3 
    :T             {                    as above                                             } 
   
    :Tabwins 1211; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'netrw_liststyle'      : 3, 
     \                                                              'ending_window_number' : 2 
    :T             {                           same args                                      } 
    " Multiple tab options in same command.  " 
 ````

# CONFIGURATION  
##### Overridable globals in _tabwins.vim_:

````vim
To change Vertical/Horizontal max dimensions:
  let g:tabwins_max_v_size                   = {N}
  let g:tabwins_max_h_size                   = {N}  
Default: '15' for each

To limit tabwins.vim load to once per Vim session:
  let g:tabwins_multiple_loads_are_permitted = 'N' 
Default: 'Y'

To prevent 'Tabwins' menu addition when tabwins loads:
  let g:load_tabwins_menu_is_wanted          = 'N' 
Default: 'Y'

To change the 'Tabwins' menu number:
  let g:tabwins_menu_number                  = {menu_number} 
Default: '9998'

To turn off creation of :{tabwins_cmd} aliases
  let  g:tabwins_create_aliases_is_wanted    = 'N' 
Default: 'Y'
=> Creation of an alias command will NOT occur when an existing command has the same name.

:{tabwins_cmd} Alias Defaults:
  let g:tabwins_alias            = 'T' 
  let g:tabwinsvertical_alias    = 'V' 
  let g:tabwinshorizontal_alias  = 'H' 
  let g:tabwinsfindtabwins_alias = 'TF' 

To change the default beginning window number for filling fill_specs
  let g:tabwins_first_window_number_default  = {N} 
Default: '1'
Calls to Fill_tab() can override this on a per-tab basis.

To change the default window number active on :{tabwins_cmd} completion
  let g:tabwins_ending_window_number_default = {N} 
Default: '1' 
Calls to Fill_tab() can override this on a per-tab basis.

To change the default directory Explore command:
  let g:explore_cmd_name                     = {explore_command_name} 
Default: 'Explore'

To change the default top-line of netrw windows:
  let g:tabwins_netrw_line_number_default    = {N} 
Default: 'g:tabwins_netrw_line_number_dirpath', which defaults to 3
Calls to Fill_tab() can override this on a per-tab basis.

To change the default netrw liststyle:
  let g:tabwins_netrw_liststyle_default      = {N} 
Default: '1'
Calls to Fill_tab() can override this on a per-tab basis.
if netrw var g:netrw_liststyle is not defined, it gets this value.
````

## VERTICAL & HORIZONTAL

Windows are built one axis at a time. The first axis built is the **primary axis**, and the other axis is the **secondary axis.**

If a tab starts by building the vertical axis, then the vertical axis is the primary axis, and the horizontal axis is the secondary axis. And vice-versa.

_**What's the difference between Horizontal & Vertical Tabs ?**_

  Structurally, V2x3 is the same as H3x2.  The only difference is how Vim numbers the tabs, based on the axis that is the primary axis.  
  
**IF the primary axis is vertical**, then numbering starts in col 1 and goes down the windows in col 1, then to the top of col 2, then down col 2, and so on.  
  
**IF the primary axis is horizontal**, numbering starts in row 1 and goes left to right, then to row 2, left to right, and so on.

Most of the asymmetric tab builders defined in the plugin use a vertical primary axis.  Developers can define any mix of primary axis in their own tab builders.

## ADDING NEW BUILDERS

#### Auto-generated builders of symmetric tabs

Sourcing of _tabwins.vim_ creates tab builder commands on the HxV and VxH permutations of:
````vim
      g:tabwins_max_v_size  
      g:tabwins_max_h_size 
````

_**Increase**_ either/both of these, for additional commands that build tabs with more windows.

Of course, this command set can be _**reduced by**_ lowering the values of the same globals.  

#### As you like it
  
Adapt the below example to create your own commands that build tabs with the window structures and content that you want.  
````vim
        let                g:home_parent_dirpath = substitute(finddir($HOME), '\/\w\+$', '', 'g')
        command! TabwinsHomeDir :Tabwins 232; 
          \   $HOME, 
          \   'Explore ' . g:home_parent_dirpath . ' | resize 30',
          \
          \   'edit! /.bashrc',
          \   '/.gitignore',
          \   'enew!',
          \
          \   '/.vimrc',
          \   '/.vim'
          \;
          \ 'line_number_at_window_top' : 1 

          " windows are filled with the order of elements
          " in 'fill_specs' You want to spec something for each
          " of the windows created by :Tabwins 232,
          " either commands, filepaths, or dirpaths. Spec an empty
          " string to bypass the fill of a window buffer.
          " Specs can include shell or vim vars, and if files or dirs
          " the spec can include a vim command or use the default :edit or
          " :Explore call in Fill_tab()

          " NOTE-the .vim file implementation defines 'home_parent_dirpath' as
          " as a vimscript var, i.e. 's:home_parent_dirpath' -- it's changed
          " here to facilitate experimentation."
